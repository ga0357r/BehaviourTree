# Behavior Tree Implementation in Unity Engine
This is an implementation of the Behavior Tree algorithm in the Unity Engine using C# programming language. The implementation allows game developers to add complex behaviors to their game characters.

# Features
Supports various types of behavior nodes, including selector, sequence, and action nodes.
Allows easy customization and extension of behavior tree nodes to fit different requirements.

# Getting Started
To use this implementation, simply download or clone the repository, open the Unity project. Based on the example EnemyChild script, you can create your own script that references the behaviour tree or customize the existing EnemyChild script. You can also customize and extend the behavior nodes as needed to create your desired behavior tree.

You can also extract the Behaviour Tree Folder that contains the "Behavior Tree.asmd"and put it in your own project to start using the Behaviour Tree API.
